					<h1>Aclipsa SDK Startup Guide</h1>

<p>Welcom to the Aclipsa SDK.  The SDK allows you to integrate the Aclipsa video messaging service into your apps.</p>

<h2>Section 1 - What is in the Aclipsa SDK</h2>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>This is where we document the Aclipsa SDK classes that you can use while developing your applications.</p>

<h3>Framework</h3>

<p>The framework contains all of the compiled code and the header files for the classes that are included in the Aclipsa SDK.</p>

<p>The framework includes AFNetworking v2.  It does not need to be added to your project and can be used from the framework by including <AclipsaSDK/AFNetworking> or any of it&rsquo;s specific headers.</p>

<h3>Resources Bundle</h3>

<p>The resources bundle contains any project assets that are needed by the SDK.</p>

<h3>Sample Application</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;ve included a sample application to help you get started with the SDK.  The Aclipsa SDK Demo application shows you how to use most of the features of the SDK.</p>

<h2>Section 2 - How do I use the Aclipsa SDK</h2>

<h3>Basic Architecture</h3>

<p>Using the SDK centers around the <a href="../../Classes/ACLIPSession.html">ACLIPSession</a> class.  It&rsquo;s the hub for communication with the Aclipsa servers. It coordinates all of the communication and data management in the SDK.  Apps should first create a session with the createSessionWithAppID class method and then use the activeSession class method for all future access.  Only one session will ever be created per launch.  The session will then allow to perform all other SDK functions, ie login, logout, loading video list, uploading vides, etc.</p>

<p>All network communication in the Aclipsa SDK is asynchronous and uses blocks to notify the caller when a network call has completed or if an error has occurred.  All network based methods will take two blocks as parameters, one that will be called on a successful completion and one that gets called if any error occurs.  For methods that load data from the network the completion block may be called more than once.  An initial call with cached data can happen with an additional call happening once the data is refreshed.</p>

<h2>Section 3 - Registering an App with Aclipsa</h2>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t already received an API and Shared Secret for your app, please contact support@aclipsa.com</p>

<h2>Section 4 - Building an App with the Aclipsa SDK</h2>

<h3>Xcode Project Configuration</h3>

<p>A few steps need to be taken in order to get your project to build correctly with the Aclipsa SDK.  First you need to add the -ObjC flag to Other Linker Flags.  This allows the SDK to correctly link with your project.</p>

<p><img src="./linkerFlags.png" height="228" width="868" alt="Linker_Flags" /></p>

<p>Next you need to link a few of the system frameworks and libraries to your project.  These enable various features like video playback to work.  The required frameworks and libraries are:</p>

<ul>
<li>libz.dylib</li>
<li>AssestsLibrary.framework</li>
<li>AVFoundation.framework</li>
<li>CoreData.framework</li>
<li>CoreImage.framework</li>
<li>CoreLocation.framework</li>
<li>CoreMedia.framework</li>
<li>MediaPlayer.framework</li>
<li>SystemConfiguration.framework</li>
</ul>


<p>In the project editor, select your Target and highlight the Build Phases tab.  Expand “Link Binary With Libraries.” Click the + button and add the required libraries.</p>

<p><img src="./linkedLibraries.png" height="433" width="705" alt="Required_Libraries" /></p>

<p>You also need to add the Aclipsa SDK framework and resources bundle along with the AWS Mobile Framework for iOS v2 to your project. The simplest way to add them is to simply drag and drop them into your project&rsquo;s file list.  You can also add them through the Add File menu items if you prefer.  The following provided files need to be added:</p>

<ul>
<li>AclipsaSDK.framework</li>
<li>AclipsaSDK.bundle</li>
<li>S3 folder which contains a 3rd party folder, AWSiOSSDKv2.framework, and a JSON folder.</li>
</ul>


<p>The AWS framework can be downloaded from <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdk/">http://aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdk/</a></p>

<p>At this point your project is set-up to use the Aclipsa SDK.  You should start off you&rsquo;re use by creating an <a href="../../Classes/ACLIPSession.html">ACLIPSession</a> in your - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication <em>)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary </em>)launchOptions method with:</p>

<pre><code>[ACLIPSession createSessionWithAppID:@"Your App ID" serverEnvironment:ACLIPDevelopmentServer]
</code></pre>

<p>All future access and calls to the session should then use</p>

<pre><code>[ACLIPSession activeSession]
</code></pre>

<p>to access the session.</p>
