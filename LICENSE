Limited License for Aclipsa Sample Code. Subject to Developer’s compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Aclipsa hereby grants to Developer a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, personal license to create Derivative Works of the Aclipsa Sample Code solely for the purpose of developing and testing Applications.C.

Open Source Software: To the extent any license to any Open Source Software requires that Aclipsa provide Developer the rights to copy, modify, distribute or otherwise use any Open Source Software that are inconsistent with the limited rights granted to Developer in this Agreement, then such rights in the applicable Open Source Software license shall take precedence over the rights and restrictions granted in this Agreement, but solely with respect to such Open Source Software.

Developer shall comply with the terms of all applicable Open Source Software licenses, if any. If Your Application includes any Open Source Software, You agree to comply with all applicable Open Source Software licensing terms.

Aclipsa shall defend You against any claim brought by a third party against You alleging that the Aclipsa Software provided by Aclipsa to You under this Agreement infringes a patent, trade secret, copyright or other intellectual property right (“Infringement Claim”), but only if: (a) You promptly notify Aclipsa in writing of such Infringement Claim and such notification occurs while this Agreement remains in effect; (b) Aclipsa is given sole authority and control of the defense of such Infringement Claim; and (c) You supply all requested information and assistance to Aclipsa, at Aclipsa’s reasonable expense, for resolution or defense of the Infringement Claim.
